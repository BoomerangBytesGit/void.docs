# Manager

The following guide is a high level abstraction for the admin of the OS, it is made to be user friendly and tackle issues you or others may face.

The manager is a KVM Hypervisor, a computer that runs other computers inside of it. It is just as complex as you decide to make it. Do not modify unless you are following specific instructions to diagnose/fix a issue or have technical experience.

A single mistake can lock you out, break security or break the whole system.


You can find in depth/technical documentation on the manager here https://pve.proxmox.com/pve-docs/
